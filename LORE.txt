## COUNTRIES
- **Kinketsu-koku** | Japan-inspired | Geographic: Lake-rich, many rivers, fertile lowlands | Government: Hierarchical noble democracy, only nobles may vote. Nobility divided into three ranks: Shinden (High Nobility), Kanrei (Middle Nobility), Hōnin (Lower Nobility). Highest sovereign is the Ōza (Grand Seat), elected from Shinden.
- **Tonglian** | China-inspired | Geographic: Northern arid steppes, southern fertile basin along the Shuilong River ("River of the Water Dragon") | Government: Militaristic federation of warring states. Ruled by generals/warlords, strongest are seated in the Jiǔ Shì Táng (Hall of Nine Powers).
- **Gungtong** | Korea-inspired | Geographic: Jagged cliffs, hills, impassable ridges; heavy reliance on ships | Government: Absolute king with subordinate chieftains. Known for mercenary tradition: warrior companies called Hwaryeongdan (Flame Companies), who sell allegiance to keep balance of power between neighbors.
- **Asap Naga** | Malay-inspired | Geographic: Archipelago stretching north forests to southern jungles. Dominates trade straits. | Government: Maritime confederacy of naval clans. Strongest navy, minimal army. Neutral power, sustains influence through five great trading guilds: Kalipon (Filipino), Sundira (Indonesian), Melayu’an (Malay/Singaporean), Ayutara (Thai), Veylong (Viet).
## POLITICAL ALLIANCE
- Fluid alliances. Kinketsu-koku and Tonglian share contested borders and waters, frequent clashes but not outright war.
- Gungtong’s mercenaries sell their strength to both sides to prevent hegemony.
- Asap Naga trades with all, profiting from others’ rivalries.
## GEOGRAPHIC FEATURES
- **Pulau Seribu Api** (“Isles of a Thousand Flames”) | Island chain of Asap Naga, stretching north to south. Northern islands dense with forests, southernmost covered in steaming jungles. Core of naval and trading guild power.  
- **Daesan** (대산, “Great Mountain”) | The great island of Gungtong. Defined by jagged cliffs, steep ridges, and natural barriers. Inland travel is nearly impossible, forcing reliance on ships for trade and war.  
- **Shinkai Zhou** (深海州, “Deep Sea Continent”) | Continent holding Kinketsu-koku and Tonglian. Western side marked by lakes and rivers of Kinketsu-koku, eastern half dominated by Tonglian’s arid north and fertile southern basin. Divided by the Ryūgǔ Lóngkotsu mountains.  
### Relative Locations
- **Shinkai Zhou** lies in the north, spanning west to east. Kinketsu-koku in the west, Tonglian in the east, their contested mountains in between.  
- **Daesan** lies to the south, projecting between seas and straits, a natural wedge between continent and archipelago.  
- **Pulau Seribu Api** lies southeast, scattered islands forming the Asap Naga confederacy. Control of the straits gives them dominance over maritime trade routes.

#rpg_techs
## METALLURGY & MATERIALS
- **Iron:** Incredibly rare, effectively absent from tech or economy. Considered mythical in quality.  
- **Bronze, Copper, Tin:** Foundation of all metallurgy. Every nation produces weapons and armor, but specialization differs by geography and culture.  
- **Design Aesthetic:** Steampunk is a matter of style—bronze and copper casings, ornate gearwork, burnished surfaces—rather than complex machinery. No full automatons exist; mechanisms remain early Renaissance level.  
## TONG LIAN (China-inspired)
- **Invention:** Created a gunpowder-like substance called **Huǒfěn** (火粉, “Fire Powder”). Initially unstable, more ritual than practical.  
- **Specializations:**  
  - Agriculture machinery and semi-automated planting/harvesting tools.  
  - **Jīnlú** (金輪, “Golden Wheels”): Tonglian’s name for their early “clockwork” mechanisms, using bronze gears and weighted balances.  
  - Complicated siege engines and repeating crossbows like the **Chongnu** (重弩).  
  - Primitive steam engines exist as curiosities—often in noble workshops, not practical industry.  
## GUNG TONG (Korea-inspired)
- **Discovery:** Perfected the **Huǒfěn** ratio, making it viable for warfare.  
- **Specializations:**  
  - Gunpowder-based weaponry: bronze-lined bamboo muskets, single-use rockets, and the **Hwacha** (火車, “Fire Wagon”).  
  - Exporters of weaponry; their mercenary companies arm themselves with their own advanced designs.  
  - Renowned for precise machining of firing mechanisms and intricate trigger systems.  
## KINKETSU-KOKU (Japan-inspired)
- **Specializations:**  
  - Metallurgy: Thin bronze alloys of extreme durability, reserved for nobility and military elites. Famous for elegant swords and dense armor.  
  - Glasswork: Rivers and lakes provide unusually pure sand, producing high-quality glass. Used in spectacles, goggles, and scientific instruments.  
  - Hybrid Crafting: Zealously guarded traditions within noble houses blend glass with lacquer, ceramics, and wood to create unique goods (e.g., composite goggles, ceremonial glass-lacquer armor plating).  
  - Decorative arts: Export of ceramics, lacquerware, and refined tools reinforces their cultural prestige.  
## ASAP NAGA (Malay-inspired)
- **Specializations:**  
  - Naval Power: Mastery of shipbuilding.  
    - Everyday vessels: Multi-mast **Vinta-kora** (hybrid of vinta and outrigger catamaran). Fast, shallow-draft, ideal for inter-island trade.  
    - Warships: **Kura-kapal** (“Turtle Ships”), plated with overlapping bronze-studded panels for defense, slow but nearly unsinkable in coastal waters.  
  - Material Industries: Focus on spice drying, food preservation, and efficient storage for trade.  
  - Logistics: Renaissance-level organization of warehouses, ports, and trade routes. Their navy acts as the spine of their confederacy.  
## INDUSTRY LEVEL
- Comparable to early Renaissance Europe. Skilled artisans and engineers exist, but large-scale automation and industrialization are absent. Mechanics remain craft-based and localized.  
- Each nation’s specialization reflects resource availability and political culture.

#rpg_economy
## GENERAL
- All nations have merchants, but the Asap Naga trading guilds dominate interregional commerce.  
- Iron: Scarce and absent from most economies. Copper and bronze define metallurgy and trade.  
- Currency: Silver coins (half-ounce) minted by each kingdom with unique designs and varying purity. Gold is prized for jewelry, ornamentation, and high crafts, not currency.  
- Kinketsu-koku and Tonglian: Trade between them is limited due to frequent border skirmishes.  
## ASAP NAGA
- Core of the regional trade system. Their neutrality and geography give them the largest distribution network.  
- **Exports & Goods:** Spices (pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon), dried fish, preserved fruits, rare hardwoods, resins, pearls, jungle herbs, lacquer oils, and textiles.  
- **Financial Services:** Nascent lending and warehousing, operated by guilds. Limited compared to modern banking, but influential.  
## GUNGTONG
- Rugged terrain restricts agriculture, so weapons and mercenary services form the basis of the economy.  
- **Exports & Goods:** Bronze-lined muskets, single-use rockets, hwacha carts, heavy shields, and mercenary contracts.  
- Mercenary companies act as “war merchants,” but royal decree restricts export to last-generation weapons, ensuring the king’s monopoly on cutting-edge arms.  
- Imports: Grain, fruits, and rice to support the population.  
## KINKETSU-KOKU
- Economy centered on crafts and artistry, tightly controlled by noble houses. Internal trade is sustained by the river system; external trade limited.  
- **Exports & Goods:** Bronze swords and armor, spectacles and goggles (glass-lacquer hybrids), lacquerware, ceramics, glass ceramics, paper lanterns, and fine textiles.  
- Self-sufficient in food production thanks to rivers and lakes.  
## TONGLIAN
- Economy built on regional balance: arid north provides meats, hides, and base metals; fertile south is the breadbasket of the continent.  
- **Exports & Goods:** Rice, wheat, preserved meats, bronze gear-driven mechanisms, chongnu repeating crossbows, siege devices, and farming automata.  
- Trade abroad emphasizes surplus agriculture and intricate gearwork devices.

The first noble election in Kinketsu-koku occurs, creating a hierarchical democracy with the Shinden (High Nobility) rising as the political elite. The collapse of a previous Tonglian empire sets the stage for the Nine Generals Era, with rival factions vying for power in the wake of the empire's disintegration.
**Year 87**: Kinketsu-koku and Tonglian engage in their first major war, a devastating conflict that results in the Seokgwi Oni migrating to Gungtong in search of refuge, shaping Gungtong’s military and political landscape for centuries to come. The war ends in a tense truce, but the seeds for future conflicts are sown.
**Year 160**: The war between Kinketsu-koku and Tonglian officially ends. The Ryūgǔ Lóngkotsu Mountains are declared the official border, a natural barrier between the two kingdoms that will be respected by both nations for generations. The era of skirmishes gives way to uneasy peace, though tensions remain high.
**Year 215**: The discovery of Huǒfěn (Fire Powder) revolutionizes warfare across the continent, and both Kinketsu-koku and Tonglian compete to refine its uses. Emas Lautan and Shirogane no Mizuhito are officially recognized as citizens of Asap Naga and Kinketsu-koku, respectively, as the once-insular societies begin to accept the bipedal merfolk as part of their growing empires. Their influence begins to grow, particularly in the realms of trade and artistry.
**Year 287**: Skirmishes between Kinketsu-koku and Tonglian continue, while Tonglian makes significant strides in agricultural development. Meanwhile, the Seokgwi Oni and Iwayama are officially recognized as citizens of Gungtong and Kinketsu-koku/Tonglian, respectively, marking a significant shift toward integration. These peoples now hold a vital place within their respective nations.
**Year 380**: Gungtong perfects the use of Huǒfěn in weaponry, marking the rise of Gungtong’s mercenaries. With their advanced gunpowder-based weaponry, Gungtong mercenaries begin to dominate the region, offering their services to the highest bidder in wars across the continent.
**Year 420**: The Asap Naga Trading Fleet becomes a full-fledged naval fleet, bolstered by the rise of the first Great Pirate who wreaks havoc on their trade routes. In response, Asap Naga solidifies its naval dominance, cementing its role as a neutral power in the region. Kinketsu-koku undergoes a Glass and Ceramic Revolution, creating fine glassware and intricate ceramics that soon become highly prized throughout the world.
**Year 511**: A drought in northern Tonglian forces the migration of Huǒlóng Dragons into the southern regions, ravaging the southern Tonglian territories. The destruction forces Tonglian’s leadership to focus on reconstruction, which leads to the development of new defensive technologies.
**Year 593**: A high-profile assassination within Kinketsu-koku’s Shinden points to Tonglian agents, reigniting hostilities between the two nations. This marks the beginning of a new era of tension, as political intrigue and espionage reach new heights. The assassination sets off a wave of distrust, and noble houses rally behind their leaders in preparation for future conflict.
**Year 654**: The Kinketsu-koku x Tonglian War 2 erupts. The conflict begins with a fierce battle for the Ryūgǔ Lóngkotsu Mountains, leading to the capture of valuable lands over the mountain range. This war sets the stage for a prolonged battle that lasts for decades.
**Year 707**: A devastating plague, known as the Plague of Haman, strikes the lands of Kinketsu-koku and Tonglian, a byproduct of the prolonged war. Gungtong’s coastal areas are also affected due to the influx of mercenaries seeking refuge. In response, Asap Naga enforces a strict border closure policy, isolating itself from the chaos.
**Year 740**: The war between Kinketsu-koku and Tonglian reaches a stalemate, forced to end due to the far-reaching effects of the plague. Both nations are left decimated, their populations shattered, and the economy of the region comes to a grinding halt.
**Year 792**: The Shirogane no Mizuhito and Emas Lautan alchemists and medical researchers create a groundbreaking herbal remedy that stems the plague, saving countless lives. The Shirogane no Mizuhito are granted a place in the nobility of Kinketsu-koku in recognition of their medical contributions.
**Year 804**: Gungtong’s King completes the unification of the island, solidifying his reign and creating a stable kingdom. This era marks the rise of Gungtong’s influence in the region as it becomes a beacon of stability. Asap Naga establishes its first Trading House outside of its territory, securing dominance over the maritime trade routes.
**Year 890**: Gungtong mercenaries are involved in Kinketsu-koku x Tonglian skirmishes, offering their services once more. The conflict continues to simmer under the surface, but no full-scale war breaks out. Asap Naga signs an official neutrality pact with all neighboring nations, asserting its stance as a peaceful trading hub, though its merchants still maintain considerable influence.
**Year 952**: The pirate raids of Asap Naga cities reach a fever pitch, resulting in the loss of some coastal territories. Kinketsu-koku advances in metallurgy during this period, developing stronger alloys and intricate bronze works that are exported across the continent.
**Year 1005**: The development of Kura-kapal naval vessels, made by Asap Naga, revolutionizes their naval warfare, providing unmatched protection from pirate attacks. The Seokgwi Oni are officially allowed to join Gungtong’s mercenary ranks, further bolstering the kingdom’s military strength.
**Year 1050**: Mechanical siege weapons development in both Tonglian and Kinketsu-koku advances significantly, with both nations turning the tides of warfare in their favor. The first Lending House of Asap Naga opens, offering financial services to the expanding trade networks. Meanwhile, Gungtong enacts “Maintain Balance of Powers” reforms, ensuring mercenaries remain a tool for diplomacy rather than uncontrolled forces of destruction.
**Year 1071**: Current world. The balance between nations remains volatile, with Kinketsu-koku, Tonglian, Gungtong, and Asap Naga continuing to maneuver politically and militarily for influence over the surrounding lands. The foundations of diplomacy, warfare, and trade are more complex than ever, and the consequences of past events shape the actions of today's leaders.
